    				I'm currently learning computer science at Faculty of Computer Science, University of Indonesia. When I first studying here, I had 0 knowledge about computer science. <br> <br>

    				First semester, I learnt how to code, with Python for the basic, I'm not very good at first so my grade at Foundation Programming 1 is not really good. At that time, I learnt about Discrete Math for basic of programming logic, it was fun subject because it teach you how to think. <br><br>

    				Second semester, I learnt Java. For me, Java is really great when it goes to OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), I understand the concept of OOP when I learn Java, even though I learn it too in Programming Foundation 1 which is using Python. <br><br>

    				Third semester is a chaos, I learn about Data Structure and Algorithm and it is stressing me out, even though it is hard I must give my best at it because it is a foundation to be a Software Engineer, which is one of my career goal. Also I learn about how to making website using Python Django. This website actually part of the task of that subject. I also learn how to code in assembly language that I don't really like
